# Rainmeter-Icons
This is nothing new and is actually based on other rainmeter skins I've seen/utilized. However, I felt that maybe there are some people who want a simple starting point for icons which I have provided here. Please note any image can essentially be an icon (pngs are my most utilized for obvious reasons) and these can be beyond simple links to applications. I would suggest looking into other functionality like running scripts or even controlling your computer's power. Ultimately clicking to open files is simplest functionality; however, you should be aware that there is far more than this.

## Steps
1) Download rainmeter
2) After downloading/installing go to folder located in "C:\Users\[USER NAME]\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins"
3) Place the DesktopIcons folder that I have provided in this folder
4) Any icon pictures you want place in the root of the @Resources folder
5) Any new icon you add you must create a new folder (not in the @Resources folder) and add a corresponding .ini file
	- There is a template of this folder and file you can modify and use
	- As an example you can create a folder called "example" and add a file called "example.ini" to it
6) In the rainmeter application click the folder for "DesktopIcons" then click the corresponding .ini file and load it in
	- When highlighted you can click Load, Refresh, or Edit
	- Edit is important if you want to modify any of the settings for the icon in the .ini file
	
# Note 
To personalize the respective .ini files follow the comments inside the "template.ini" for tips. I've also included options for sound effects, if you don't want these then just add a comment in front like so ";".
